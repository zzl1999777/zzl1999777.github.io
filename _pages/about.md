I am Zi-Liang Zhang (张子良), a PhD candidate in University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I got my Astronomy Master degree in Institude of Astrophysics, [College of Physical Science and Technology](http://physics.ccnu.edu.cn/English.htm), [Central China Normal University(华中师范大学)](http://english.ccnu.edu.cn/).



My interests extend deeply into the realm of High-energy transient phenomena modeling and multi-messenger astronomy. I am particularly fascinated by the dynamic processes and mechanisms that drive high-energy events in the universe, such as fast radio bursts, gamma-ray bursts, and compact binary mergers. My focus lies in developing and refining models that can accurately simulate these transient phenomena, providing insights into their underlying physics. 
Additionally, my enthusiasm for multi-messenger astronomy stems from its potential to offer a more comprehensive understanding of cosmic events by integrating information across electromagnetic, gravitational, and neutrino signals, thereby painting a fuller picture of these enigmatic occurrences in the cosmos.

I am also a amateur astronomer, I love organize star party and take beautiful astrography photos. Furthermore, share and explain interesting physics behind what we see with naked eyes.
